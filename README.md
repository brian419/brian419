- Hi, Iâ€™m @brian419 or Jeongbin Son. 
- Iâ€™m interested in a lot of areas of coding such as app development and web development, etc. 
- As such, I am learning how to build IOS applications using SwiftUI and Xcode and Three.js to create interactive websites
- To develop my skillsets, I focus on working on projects that can showcase my skills in SwiftUI, Three.js / Javascript (HTML Canvas), C and C++.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at 'json10@crimson.ua.edu'! 
- Portfolio Website built from Three.js: https://www.jeongbinson.com/
